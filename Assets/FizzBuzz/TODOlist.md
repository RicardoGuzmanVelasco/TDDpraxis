### Basic API
- [X] API: Return FizzBuzz of a number
- [ ] Implementations to internal
  - [ ] Tests are friend package of Runtime

### Test API
- [ ] Special numbers array
- [ ] Common numbers array
- [ ] Words

- Use Test API in all fixtures 

### Control cases
- [x] FizzBuzz of non-positive precondition error
- [x] FizzBuzz of positive NO precondition error

### Common cases 
- [x] FizzBuzz of non-3or5multiple is the number itself
- [x] FizzBuzz of non-3or5multiple is the number itself

### Special cases
- [x] FizzBuzz of any multiple of 3 not multiple of 5 is Fizz
- [x] FizzBuzz of any multiple of 5 not multiple of 3 is Buzz
- [x] FizzBuzz of any multiple of 3 and multiple of 5 is Fizz Buzz

### Refactoring
- [x] Non static
  - [x] Abstraction

- [x] Multiple/DivisibleBy computed by extension
- [x] Switch to delegation 
  - [x] Switch to association
  - [x] Switch to composition

### Alternative implementations
